        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cucumbers</strong>: This bibimap recipe starts with cucumbers, cut into matchsticks, mixed with gochujang (optional, but it adds subtle heat).  </li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: You will also need spinach, cut into thin strips, and carrots, cut into matchsticks. </li>
                <li><strong>Soy sauce</strong>: Soy sauce lends umami-rich flavor. </li>
                <li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Cook the carrots and garlic in olive oil.</li>

                <li><strong>Steak</strong>: This recipe calls for thinly-sliced beef â€” top round steak is rich and beefy, which makes it perfect for bibimbap.</li>

                <li><strong>Rice</strong>: Ladle each serving over bibimbap over a cup of cooked white rice.</li>
